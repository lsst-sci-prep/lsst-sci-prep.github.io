  <p><strong>To enter the plenary session: </strong> Move your avatar to the top-right of the map and enter the door marked <strong>"West Conference Room"</strong>.  This will
    take you into a conference hall, and you will see a large meeting icon in front of you.
    You will need to move your avatar close to this icon, to see a pop up instruction "Press x to interact".  Press "x", and you will
    be shown the link to the Zoom room for the plenary session meeting.
    Click the link to join the session.</p>
  <p><strong>Breakout sessions: </strong> The map includes several named meeting rooms which are
  open for use for breakout discussions.  None of the rooms are reserved (except the West conference room),
  and attendees are encouraged to self-organize and nominate a location to meet.
There are also numerous tables and smaller meeting spaces provided across the map which you are welcome to use. </p>

<div id="CodeOfConduct" class="tabcontent">
  <p>Rubin Observatory enforces the <a href="https://www.aura-astronomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/B25-B-XXV-Standards-of-Workplace-Conduct.pdf">AURA Harassment and Code of Conduct Policy</a>.
    Harassment and unprofessional conduct (including the use of offensive language)
    of any kind is not permitted at any time and should be reported per the
    instructions in the Reporting section of this page.</p>
  <p>Rubin Science Collaboration members are also expected to adhere to their Collaboration's Codes of Conduct.</p>

<h2>Our Values</h2>
<p>Rubin Observatory adheres to the following principles in order to provide a
  learning environment that produces rigor and excellence:</p>

<h3>Be Kind</h3>
<p>Acting with and encouraging kindness strengthens individuals, relationships, and communities.</p>

<h3>Trust</h3>
<p>An inclusive, collaborative environment is best achieved when there is mutual
  trust, based upon honest behavior, throughout the community.</p>

<h3>Respect</h3>
<p>Inclusive environments foster excellence by challenging us to consider a
  variety of viewpoints and approaches. We honor alternate viewpoints as
  opportunities for discussion and learning, and therefore treat others with
  respect, even if we disagree.</p>

<h3>Diversity</h3>
<p>In a diverse community, differences between people are recognized and
  acknowledged as assets. Our community is stronger, more creative, and more
  innovative because it is fueled by a broad range of ideas and perspectives.</p>

<h3>Inclusiveness</h3>
<p>Rubin recognizes the importance of actively including and encouraging involvement
  from all corners; diversity is only a benefit if all members feel empowered
  to participate. Quoting from the AAS guidelines: "Scientists should work to
  provide an environment that encourages the free expression and exchange of
  scientific ideas.  They should promote equality of opportunity and fair treatment
  for all their colleagues, regardless of gender, race, ethnic and national origin
  (including Indigenous Peoples), religion, age, marital status, sexual orientation,
  gender identity and expression, disability, veteran status, etc. Scientific
  ability must be respected wherever it is found."</p>

<h3>Inclusive environment</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.stinsondesign.com/blog/ultimate-guide-accessible-presentation-design">Guidelines</a>
  are given to presenters encourage them to use color palettes and fonts
  that are suitable for color-blind and dyslexic participants. Dedicated Slack
  channels and social platforms with a dedicated hashtag will help people to follow
  essential parts of the discussions; this meeting's hashtag is #hst-lsst-sci-prep
  on the LSST Slack Team. </p>
<p>Participants are advised to be mindful and respectful of cultural differences
  between the participants. Many countries with very different cultural backgrounds,
  languages, and timezones are represented at this virtual meeting, and it is
  every participant’s duty to make sure everybody feels welcome in our community.
  The organizers have made an attempt to schedule the meeting at times that maximize
  participation across the globe but recognize that the schedule will not be suitable
  for everyone. Session recordings will be made available.</p>

<p>The program organizers firmly reject all kinds of abusive behavior. The organizers
  have worked towards providing a welcoming, safe environment that encourages the
  free expression and exchange of ideas of all the participants. Every attendee is
  expected to make their individual contribution towards a respectful and inclusive
  meeting climate. Any discriminatory behavior against colleagues on any basis, such
  as gender, gender identity, race, ethnic background, national origin, religion,
  political affiliation, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities or
  any other reason will not be tolerated during any Rubin Observatory event. </p>

<p>All sessions may be recorded. As a presenter or participant of the meeting, your
  image and/or your voice may appear in recordings that may be publicly accessible.
  If you prefer your image not to appear, presenters and participants are welcome
  to keep the video muted. As a participant, to avoid your voice being recorded
  you may consider asking questions in the chat or on slack.</p>

<p>Presenters or attendees acting inappropriately or using inappropriate language
  may be muted (video, voice, chat) or removed from the meeting by the moderator.</p>

<h3>Reporting bullying, harassment or aggression at the Workshop</h3>
<p>The Program Lead, Rachel Street, (rstreet at lco.global) will act as the designated
  contact person for reporting instances of bullying, harassment, or aggression.</p>

<p>In the case that an event is reported, and with the approval of the reporting person,
  the designated contact person will approach the offending person(s) to discuss how
  their behavior is causing distress to other participants and remind them of the
  code of conduct applicable to all participants. If more serious measures are needed,
  the designated contact person should inform the reporting person(s) of the procedure
  to follow in these cases.</p>

<p>Should a participant witness events of bullying, harassment or aggression, the
  recommendation is to contact the person who suffered the abuse to show support,
  ask how they are doing, and possibly suggest for them to talk to one of the
  designated contact people. The decision to approach the contact person should,
  however, ultimately be left to the the person who suffered the abuse.</p>

<h3>Principles of Engagement</h3>
<p>The following are a few basic social rules, adapted from those of the Recurse
  Center. These rules make explicit certain norms of social behavior that help
  uphold our values stated in the Code of Conduct above, as well as the <a href="https://project.lsst.org/workplace-culture">ethical
  guidelines</a> we endorse. If you mess up on any of the below,
  don’t panic: we all make mistakes sometimes. Apologize, reflect, move forward.
  If someone points out that you have engaged in this behavior, it can be tempting
  to become defensive—but instead, apologize, reflect a moment, and move on. </p>

<h3>No -isms</h3>
<p>We explicitly ban racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other kinds of
  bias— whether these behaviors are overt or subtle. Subtle -isms can be particularly
  tricky, as they are often unconscious behaviors we engage in by mistake, and are
  sometimes caused by conflicting norms between cultures. To use an example from
  Recurse, saying "It's so easy my grandmother could do it" is a subtle -ism.
  Refrain from equating any category of people to a specific behavior.</p>

<h3>Raise All Voices</h3>
<p>During sessions and discussions, pay attention to who is contributing. Chairs
  are encouraged to be conscious of their biases and avoid preferentially
  selecting some people and/or paying attention to only some parts of the room.
  Discreetly invite contributions from quieter members of the group, making sure
  you are not embarassing them or drawing undesirable attention (ask "what do
  junior people think" or "people from smaller colleges" for example) and be
  conscientious of not dominating the conversation. We understand that it can be
  exciting to discuss a new idea, but always strive to listen (rather than just
  wait your turn to speak).</p>

<h3>Take time to explain and do not belittle others</h3>
<p>In an environment where participants have different backgrounds and knowledge,
  it is very important that people feel comfortable saying “I don’t know” or “I
  don’t understand.” Therefore, please do not act surprised when someone says
  they don’t know something, whether it is regarding a technical or non-technical
  subject (e.g. “What?! I can’t believe you don’t know what X is!”). Quoting from
  Recurse: "Feigning surprise has absolutely no social or educational benefit—instead,
  take time to explain so that all can follow and participate in the conversation.</p>

<h3>Choose constructive, rather than demeaning reactions</h3>
<p>If you experience these behaviors during the course of the meeting, you should
  feel free to bring it up directly with the person, or if it’s more comfortable,
  point out the behavior to the meeting organizers or one of the designated contacts
  mentioned in the reporting section above.</p>
