<section-title>Program Goals and Scope</section-title>

<p>The twin goals of this program are: </p>
<p>1) to promote excellence in Rubin-related research by enabling science
  collaboration members to dedicate time to preparatory work in advance of the
  survey starting operations and </p>
<p>2) to ensure that research opportunities and facilities are accessible on a
  fair and equitable basis to all science collaboration members and to overcome
  common barriers to entry and participation</p>

<p>Both goals are considered to be equally important to the success of the program. </p>

<p>The scope of activities which may be supported by grants is quite broad, and
  the following non-exhaustive list includes a few ideas of included topics. </p>
<ul>
<li>Science Collaboration task force activities</li>
<li>Student training</li>
<li>Faculty summer salary</li>
<li>Institutional research partnerships</li>
<li>Supporting service contributions to the Science Collaborations</li>
<li>Enabling research under unusual circumstances, e.g. caregiving in a pandemic</li>
<li>Equipment, software and service costs</li>
<li>Support for junior/soft-money researchers</li>
<li>Collaboration-based Training</li>
<li>Visiting Scientist Program</li>
</ul>

<p>Applicants are encouraged to review the example proposal concepts outlined
  in more detail <a href="kickstarter_grants.html">here</a>, and in the
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjwzMsgaEuE">presentation</a>
  about the program given to the Science Collaborations.  </p>

<p>The Science Collaboration community thrives on the many contributions of its
  members and proposers are encouraged to highlight service contributions that
  they have and/or plan to make for the benefit of the Collaboration(s) and the
  wider community.  </p>

<section-title>Workshop & Mailing List</section-title>
<p>An online workshop for everyone interested in submitting a proposal will be
  held on 8 & 9 Sept, 2021.  If you would like to remain informed about the program,
  and particularly if you would like to join the workshop, please fill in
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFOI_4AdgJKBbfVJozMz6J_JXls5CggjJK2vLUHpWTXhVxUA/viewform?embedded=true">this
  contact form</a>.</p>

<section-title>Eligibility</section-title>
<p>All members of the following participating Rubin Science Collaborations are eligible to apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lsst-tvssc.github.io/">Transients and Variable Stars Science Collaboration</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rubin-smwlv.github.io/">Stars, Milky Way, and Local Volume Science Collaboration</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/">Solar System Science Collaboration</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Membership of these Collaborations is open to the US and Chilean astronomical
  communities and to international astronomers through the Rubin data rights program.
  Anyone interested in joining is encouraged to check their membership eligibility
  with the Science Collaboration representing their science area of interest.  </p>

<p>Grant applications are welcomed from members in all countries.  There are no
  geographic restrictions on eligibility, but successful applicants must be
  legally able to receive funds wired from the United States, under United States
  law (restrictions are rare, and more information can be found
  <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information">
  here</a>).  </p>

<p>Collaborative applications are encouraged and proposing teams may include
  personnel from other Rubin Science Collaborations and non-members, provided
  the proposal lead is a member of one of the participating Science Collaborations.</p>

<p>The participating Science Collaborations actively seek to nurture a culture
  that is welcoming and inclusive of people from diverse backgrounds with regard
  to race, color, sex, age, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender
  identity and/or expression, disability, and veteran status.  Proposals led by
  applicants from communities that were traditionally withheld from astronomy are
  particularly encouraged, and new Science Collaboration members are welcome.</p>

<section-title>Proposal Categories and Resources</section-title>
<p>Proposals are solicited in the following two categories.  Proposals that enhance
  the careers of junior researchers and students are particularly encouraged under both categories.</p>

<h4>Individual or team proposals</h4>
<p>Proposing teams may request up to the amount of (US) $20,000 per proposal.
  The team may consist of members from multiple institutions and science collaborations.
  It is preferred that the funds be awarded to a single lead institution, or if
  necessary to a small number of institutions.</p>

<h4>Partnership proposals</h4>
<p>This program aims to cultivate partnerships to better understand and overcome
  barriers to participation in astrophysics, particularly by members of communities
  that were traditionally discouraged from astronomy.  Such partnerships may be at
  a nascent stage, and proposals designed to lay groundwork for longer-term programs are welcome.</p>

<p>It is expected that Partnership proposals will be formed between institutions
  or groups with established Rubin research programs (including universities,
  colleges and other research and teaching institutions as well as Science Collaboration
  subgroups and Task Forces), and institutions or groups that may be new to Rubin
  research and/or which would like to become more involved, particularly those which
  serve communities that were traditionally withheld from astronomy, for example
  Minority Serving Institutions.</p>

<p>Partnerships are expected to form in advance of the proposal being submitted,
  and representatives from both institutions/groups should be PI and Co-PI.
  Proposals that seek to develop future partnerships are welcome as individual/team
  proposals.  The PI of a partnership proposal should be a full member of one of
  the participating Science Collaborations, and it is strongly encouraged, but not
  required, that the Co-PI should be or plan to become a member also.</p>

<p>Partnership proposals may request up to the amount of (US) $30,000 per proposal
  (higher than the $20,000 cap for individual/team proposals).   The proposed
  activities must benefit both partners, and the funding must be disbursed equitably.</p>

<p>Prospective applicants in this category are encouraged to reach out to the
  program’s management team for advice in advance of submitting their proposal.</p>
