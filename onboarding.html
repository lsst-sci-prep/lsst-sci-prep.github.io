<page-title>New to Rubin?</page-title>
<p><b>If you are new to the Rubin Science Collaborations, welcome!</b></p>
<p>Rubin Observatory is an exciting project with enormous scientific potential,
but it is also a major international undertaking and we understand that it can
seem overwhelming at first!  </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lsstcorporation.org/science-collaborations">Science Collaborations</a>
  are the best way to find out what's going on and
  to get involved.  Here is some more information to get you started.  Please
  reach out to the Science Collaboration that most closely matches your
  interests - their coordinators will be very happy to answer your questions!</p>

        <p>Visit the <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">project's website</a> for more
          information on the construction and management of Rubin Observatory,
          including an FAQ and an overview of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)
          that the observatory will perform.

        <section-title>Transients & Variable Stars</section-title>
        <p>Our <a href="https://lsst-tvssc.github.io/">website</a> describes the
          wide range of transient and variable star science our members are
        interested in and the work we are currently doing to prepare for this
        science with LSST.  Our <a href="/tvs_getting_started.html">Getting Started</a>
        guide will tell you more about how the group is organized. </p>
        <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MXQQzbC5HxY">Here</a> is a short video introduction to TVS, and
        you can hear more about some of our scientific research from our
        <a href="https://youtu.be/RiyGawxj7UU">TVS' Science Colloquia</a>.</p>

        <p>For the most up to date information on our group, please visit our
        <a href="https://rubin-smwlv.github.io/">website</a>.  We hold Hack Day sessions
      every two weeks where you can learn more and work hands-on with other members,
      in addition to working group meetings.  The whole Science Collaboration
      meets once a month. </p>

      <section-title>Solar System</section-title>
      <p>Our group is preparing for a range of Solar System science with LSST,
        as described in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01783">Science Roadmap</a>
        and <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ab0e10">Software Roadmap</a> publications,
        and you can learn about our most recent work via our <a href="http://www.lsstsssc.org">website</a>.
        Much of our work centers around a full density simulation of Solar System Object
        observations, which you can learn more about from our <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sssc/lsst-simulation">Github repository</a>.
