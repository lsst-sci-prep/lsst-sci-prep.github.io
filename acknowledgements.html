<page-title>Acknowledging this Program</page-title>
<p>Acknowledging this program in any publications or other products that result
  from it is tremendously helpful for us to demonstrate the impact of the program.
  We therefore request that authors include the following acknowledgement in
  all products related to the program, particularly those sponsored through
  the Kickstarter Grants:</p>
  <p><i>"This work was supported by the Preparing for Astrophysics with LSST
    Program, funded by the Heising Simons Foundation through grant 2021-2975,
    and administered by Las Cumbres Observatory."</i></p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>
