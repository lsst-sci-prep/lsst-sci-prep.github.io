<p>This program element aims to ensure all members have access to the
  computing facilities necessary for research with the vast LSST dataset, as
  well as access to training in the software development tools and techniques
  that will also be essential for research.  </p>
<p>We are pleased to coordinate with the LINCC Program for advanced computing
  services, hosted by the DiRAC Institute at the University of Washington, to
  enhance this program element.</p>

<p>Mario Juric of the University of Washington will give an in-depth introduction
  to the computing facilities available through the LINCC Program on <b>October 21</b>,
  in two virtual meetings:</p>
  <p>7am-8:30 PDT / 16:00 - 17:30 CEST and</p>
  <p>3pm-4:30pm PDT / 6pm - 7:30pm EDT</p>
  <p>The same content will be repeated at both sessions to enable participation
    from different timezones.  Please contact your Science Collaboration chairs
    for meeting connection information to these sessions. </p>
