<page-title>Introduction to the Transients and Variable Star Science Collaboration</page-title>

<p>Our group is a large, diverse collaboration, which, includes 10+ subgroups and
  Task Forces with different science interests and expertise in the transient sky
  science. You can find the most up to date information about each subgroup at
  the <a href="https://lsst-tvssc.github.io/">TVS website</a>.
</p>
<p>Membership of TVS is open to all members of the US and Chilean astronomical
  communities, and to the international astronomical community through the Rubin
  In-Kind Program.  </p>
<p>The collaboration is organized as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Federica Bianco and Rachel Street chair the TVS collaboration as a whole,
    and act as a contact point between scientists and the LSST Project and as a
    conduit to ensure relevant information is circulated, both between TVS
    subgroups and the Project as a whole.</li>
  <li>Each subgroup has a coordinator. As the TVS collaboration is large
    its impractical to whole telecons with everyone at once, so the coordinators
    are the primary link between subgroups and the TVS chairs and responsible for
    communicating with their subgroups.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main contacts for each subgroup and Task Force can be found on the
<a href="https://lsst-tvssc.github.io/">TVS website</a>.  Please reach out to the
main contact of your primary and secondary subgroups to familiarize yourself
with the current activities of the subgroup.  If you are interested in a science
topic that does not yet have a subgroup or a main contact yet, and you want to
jumpstart your TVS participation by volunteering that would be great! Let us know!</p>

<p>All TVS members are encouraged to attend the regular TVS telecons, and
  attendance is expected for subgroup coordinators, so that they are able to keep
  their subgroups up to date with TVS activities and the LSST Project as a whole.
  These telecons are held every other Tuesday at 9am PDT / noon EDT / 6pm CEST.</p>

<p>LSST uses community.lsst.org and Slack as our primary communication tools.
  All members are given access to these platforms when they join.
  There is a TVS channel (#tvs) on the LSST Slack team, with additional channels
  for the topical subgroups.  There is a community.lsst.org
  <a href="https://community.lsst.org/c/sci-collabs/tvs-sc">TVS channel</a> for
  our collaboration. There is also a <a href="https://community.lsst.org/c/sci-collabs channel">channel</a>
  for cross-collaboration discussions; private conversations that should only be
  visible to some of the TVS collaboration should be done by email.</p>
