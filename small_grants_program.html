<page-title>Small Grants Program</page-title>
<h3>Program Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Excellence in research:</b> Enable science collaboration members to dedicate time to LSST preparatory research</li>
  <li><b>Supporting the research community:</b> Ensure that research opportunities and facilities are accessible on a fair
    and equitable basis to all science collaboration members, and overcome common barriers to entry</li>
</ul>
<p>The program particularly wants to foster collaborative research, and to kickstart
  participation by researchers and institutions that have not previously been involved
  with Rubin science.  The participating Science Collaborations actively seek to nurture a culture
  that is welcoming and inclusive of people from diverse backgrounds with regard to race,
  color, sex, age, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity
  and/or expression, disability, and veteran status.  Proposals led by applicants from
  communities that were traditionally withheld from astronomy are particularly encouraged. </p>
<p>We will be hosting an online workshop on Sept 8 & 9, 2021, to foster collaborations and
  kickstart proposal collaborations.  More information on the workshop will be available shortly. </p>
<h3>Program Scale and Key Dates</h3>
  <p>We expect to award around 30 individual/team grants of about (US)$20,000 each, plus a
    smaller number of partnership grants (supporting two or more institutions) of up to around (US)$30,000 each.
    The duration of this program is 1yr, and the grants are expected to be awarded in November 2021 and
    spend the funds by July 2022.  </p>

<h3>Program Scope</h3>
<p>The program is highly flexible in the kinds of proposal that can be supported.  Here are just a few examples:</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Science Collaboration task force activities</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A Task Force from one or more of the participating Science Collaborations
    applies as a team for funds to organize a hackathon to work on the
  tasks necessary to achieve the Task Force's research goals. </p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Student training</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The PI is a faculty member at a small university, with undergraduate teaching
      responsibilities. She proposes for funds to enable 3 students (PhD students or
      undergraduates) to attend an (online) data science training course that will
      enable them to contribute to LSST research in future. The students would be
      tasked with performing anticipated analysis tasks (such as estimating the ages
      of a sample of Globular clusters) using the Rubin Science Platform (RSP)
      on simulated preview data. This
      will serve several goals: 1. It will give junior researchers an opportunity to
      learn astronomical analysis tasks; 2. It will help the less junior researchers
      climb the learning curve of the new analysis environment; 3. It will help the
      community (at all levels) gain experience in formulating the kind of scientific
      questions that the RSP will be able to answer. </p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Faculty summer salary</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The PI is a member of the teaching staff at an institute which requires its
      astronomy staff to bring in external grants to cover their summer salary.
      He regularly participates in his Science Collaboration, but the majority of
      his time is taken up with either teaching duties or commitments to other projects,
      leaving no opportunity to work on LSST-themed research, for which he has no
      other funds available. He applies for 2 months of summer salary costs to enable
      him to work on one of the key research goals for his Science Collaboration and
      to dedicate time to a leadership role providing service to the Science Collaboration.  </p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Institutional research partnerships</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The proposal is submitted jointly by PIs from two institutions. One has an
      established research program dedicated to LSST, while the other institute
      has not previously been involved and has no funds available for LSST research
      but has interested members of staff. (Applications including institutions
      serving populations traditionally witheld from astronomy are particularly encouraged.)
      The proposal requests funds to enable a student or postdoc and her mentor at the
      second institute to contribute research to one of the participating Science
      Collaborations, and includes some funds to enable their partner at the first
      institution to co-mentor the work.</p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Supporting service contributions to the Science Collaborations</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A proposal PI has held an unfunded but elected leadership and service role
      within her Science Collaboration for some time. She would like to dedicate
      more time to the role in order to coordinate and enable research through
      several subgroups and Task Forces that would benefit the Collaboration as a
      whole, but this would currently come at the expense of other commitments.
      She requests funds to cover 1 month of her time to enable her to meet the
      needs of the community. </p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Enabling research under unusual circumstances, e.g. caregiving in a pandemic</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The PI has a substantial track record of volunteering his time to support
      his Science Collaboration. He is also the parent of a young child, and the
      lack of availability of school/childcare during the pandemic has severely
      impacted the time he has had available for research over the last year.
      He applies for funds to cover childcare costs during the summer break, to
      enable him to dedicate time to contribute to a Science Collaboration Task Force.</p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Equipment, software and service costs</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A Task Force from one of the participating Science Collaborations applies as
      a group to cover the costs of storing a dataset of shared interest in a
      Cloud-hosting service, so that it is generally accessible by Science
      Collaboration members. The proposal also includes funds to enable a postdoc
      to develop software tools to enable the group to perform work of relevance
      to the Task Force goals using the Cloud-based dataset.</p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Support for junior/soft-money researchers</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The PI is a soft-money researcher who must fund all of her work time. She
      is an active member of one of the participating Science Collaborations but
      without any LSST-directed funding she cannot contribute any concentrated
      effort to developing tools or preparing for LSST science. She applies for
      2 months of salary costs to enable her to work on one of the key research
      goals for her Science Collaboration.</p>
  </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Collaboration-based Training</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The Science Collaboration chairs and/JEDI group propose to host bystander
        intervention training via an online colloquium and make it available to
        all Science Collaboration members.  They submit a small grant proposal to
        cover the $5000 fee of a training organization such as National Conflict
        Resolution Center.  </p>
    </div>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Visiting Scientist Program</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>A researcher requests funds to enable them to visit another institution
            for collaborative work. The visit would be expected to last ~2 weeks,
            requiring funds of ~$3,000 per visit per visitor, to fund lodging, travel
            and subsistence for visitors to collaborate with colleagues. The program
            would include a deliverable (e.g. a paper draft or funding proposal) as
            part of the program. Six such visitors could be funded annually for a
            cost of $18,000 per year for the visitor program. </p>
            <p>Please note: This will only be included in the program if the pandemic
              situation is safe enough for it to be viable, and that it can be safely
              offered to all members on a fair basis.  </p>
