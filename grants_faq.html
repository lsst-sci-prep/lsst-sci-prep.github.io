<page-title>Kickstarter Grants FAQ</page-title>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can a person be involved with more than one proposal?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Yes.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Are Science Collaboration chairs and group/task force coordinators eligible to apply?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Absolutely!  The program is designed to encourage all contributions to Science Collaborations, since
    they benefit the wider community.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">If I request funds for childcare support,
    are there any restrictions on who provides that care?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>No, you should decide who cares for your children!  You only need to describe
      in your proposal how funding childcare will enable your Rubin-related science. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">I'd like to propose for travel funds
    to enable a collaborator to come and work with me, but I see in the examples
    that this is subject to a caveat.  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The ongoing pandemic and uneven availability of vaccines means that we
    all face rapidly changing travel restrictions, which are different in different
   parts of the world.  You are welcome to propose for travel funds, but we recommend
 that you include a contingency plan describing how the work will proceed in the event
that travel is not possible. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Grant applications and the LSST International In-kind Program</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Members of the three participating Science Collaborations who are based outside
      the US/Chile are welcome to submit proposals, regardless of the status of any
      In-kind proposal they are involved with.  Although the topic of your proposal
      should not directly overlap with the activities covered in your in-kind program,
    complementary activities are encouraged, particularly those that benefit
    underserved communities and the Science Collaborations in general.</p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">My institution has different rules about receiving grants versus gifts.  If my proposal is successful, what category would an award fall into?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>You are encouraged to contact the Program Lead directly to discuss your situation in detail.
      In general, we prefer to distribute the awards as grants but we can do so as gifts if necessary
      to US-based institutions.  The limit of 15% on any institutional overhead remains the same. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Who should I describe as the "sponsor organization" in my institution's documentation?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>This program is funded by the Heising-Simons Foundation via a grant to Las Cumbres Observatory,
    who are handling the administration of the kickstarter grant awards.  For these
  purposes, the sponsor organization is therefore Las Cumbres Observatory.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can I apply for money to partially fund a student or post-doc position?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Yes, you may apply for funds to put towards a student or post-doc position, provided that
    you already have funding secured for the rest of that position.  You should explain in your proposal
  how the full position will be funded, and how this proposal will enable Rubin-research by you and your
post-doc/student. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">There are logistical difficulties which mean my institution can't receive funds from some or part of my grant proposal.  What can I do?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>If your proposal is successful, we prefer that the funds be awarded through your home institution.  </p>
    <p>However, we are aware of a few instances where some or all of the elements of a proposal
      cannot be handled through the administration of some institutions.  </p>
    <p>If this is the case, you are strongly encouraged to discuss the issues with the Program Lead, Rachel Street.</p>
    <p>We can issue grants to individuals, independently of their institution, for all or part of their proposal.
    In these cases, the individual receiving the funds will be responsible for ensuring that they are legally allowed to
    receive funds this way, and for compiling with any legal, tax, immigration or other requirement.  </p>
    <p>For example, students in the US with J1 visas may not receive funds <em>except</em> through their
      employer, and so would have to have the grant received by their institution.</p>
    <p>It is not necessary for PIs to describe <em>how</em> they will receive funds in the proposal itself.
      Successful PIs will be contacted once the awards are made with administrative instructions.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Who has to provide details of their <em>other</em> sources of funding in the proposal?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Anyone who would receive funds from the proposal, if it is successful, should provide
    details of any other resources, funds and grants they have access to, either
  from grants or through their institution or other avenue.  Collaborators on the grant
  who will not receive funds from the proposal do not need to provide these details. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Do Partnership proposals have to include an institution with an "established Rubin research program"?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The main criterion for selecting partnership proposals is that the proposal should be
      focused on overcoming barriers to participation in research for communities that
    have historically had fewer opporunties, particularly those that have historically
    suffered from discrimination.</p>
    <p>One common barrier to entry that newcomers to the Rubin science community have raised is
    that Rubin is a very large, multi-faceted project, and it can be difficult to know how
  to get involved unless you have connections or join an established research program.  </p>
  <p>Encouraging Partnership between institutes to enable and enhance research programs by all partners,
     making this kind of institutional knowledge and experience more widely accessible,
      is one example of how this kind of barrier can be overcome. </p>
  <p>It is worth noting that this is just one example of a partnership, and many others
  are possible; the definition is not intended to be restrictive.  Rather the program emphasizes
  that partnerships should be meaningful and equitable collaborations.  PIs are
  encouraged to consider how collaborating wih the Science Collaborations
  could help to enhance their research goals and opportunities for communities that
  have historically been witheld from astronomy.  </p>
  </div>

<section-title>Program Scope</section-title>
  <p>The program is highly flexible in the kinds of proposal that can be supported.  Here are just a few examples:</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Science Collaboration task force activities</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A Task Force from one or more of the participating Science Collaborations
      applies as a team for funds to organize a hackathon to work on the
    tasks necessary to achieve the Task Force's research goals. </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Student training</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The PI is a faculty member at a small university, with undergraduate teaching
        responsibilities. She proposes for funds to enable 3 students (PhD students or
        undergraduates) to attend an (online) data science training course that will
        enable them to contribute to LSST research in future. The students would be
        tasked with performing anticipated analysis tasks (such as estimating the ages
        of a sample of Globular clusters) using the Rubin Science Platform (RSP)
        on simulated preview data. This
        will serve several goals: 1. It will give junior researchers an opportunity to
        learn astronomical analysis tasks; 2. It will help the less junior researchers
        climb the learning curve of the new analysis environment; 3. It will help the
        community (at all levels) gain experience in formulating the kind of scientific
        questions that the RSP will be able to answer. </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Faculty summer salary</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The PI is a member of the teaching staff at an institute which requires its
        astronomy staff to bring in external grants to cover their summer salary.
        He regularly participates in his Science Collaboration, but the majority of
        his time is taken up with either teaching duties or commitments to other projects,
        leaving no opportunity to work on LSST-themed research, for which he has no
        other funds available. He applies for 2 months of summer salary costs to enable
        him to work on one of the key research goals for his Science Collaboration and
        to dedicate time to a leadership role providing service to the Science Collaboration.  </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Institutional research partnerships</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The proposal is submitted jointly by PIs from two institutions. One has an
        established research program dedicated to LSST, while the other institute
        has not previously been involved and has no funds available for LSST research
        but has interested members of staff. (Applications including institutions
        serving populations traditionally witheld from astronomy are particularly encouraged.)
        The proposal requests funds to enable a student or postdoc and her mentor at the
        second institute to contribute research to one of the participating Science
        Collaborations, and includes some funds to enable their partner at the first
        institution to co-mentor the work.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Supporting service contributions to the Science Collaborations</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A proposal PI has held an unfunded but elected leadership and service role
        within her Science Collaboration for some time. She would like to dedicate
        more time to the role in order to coordinate and enable research through
        several subgroups and Task Forces that would benefit the Collaboration as a
        whole, but this would currently come at the expense of other commitments.
        She requests funds to cover 1 month of her time to enable her to meet the
        needs of the community.  Her proposal clearly delineates her goals and the
        tasks to be performed, and demonstrates their importance for the Science Collaboration.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Enabling research under unusual circumstances, e.g. caregiving in a pandemic</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The PI has a substantial track record of volunteering his time to support
        his Science Collaboration. He is also the parent of a young child, and the
        lack of availability of school/childcare during the pandemic has severely
        impacted the time he has had available for research over the last year.
        He applies for funds to cover childcare costs during the summer break, to
        enable him to dedicate time to contribute to a Science Collaboration Task Force.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Equipment, software and service costs</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A Task Force from one of the participating Science Collaborations applies as
        a group to cover the costs of storing a dataset of shared interest in a
        Cloud-hosting service, so that it is generally accessible by Science
        Collaboration members. The proposal also includes funds to enable a postdoc
        to develop software tools to enable the group to perform work of relevance
        to the Task Force goals using the Cloud-based dataset.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Support for junior/soft-money researchers</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The PI is a soft-money researcher who must fund all of her work time. She
        is an active member of one of the participating Science Collaborations but
        without any LSST-directed funding she cannot contribute any concentrated
        effort to developing tools or preparing for LSST science. She applies for
        2 months of salary costs to enable her to work on one of the key research
        goals for her Science Collaboration.</p>
    </div>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Collaboration-based Training</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The Science Collaboration chairs and/JEDI group propose to host bystander
          intervention training via an online colloquium and make it available to
          all Science Collaboration members.  They submit a small grant proposal to
          cover the $5000 fee of a training organization such as National Conflict
          Resolution Center.  </p>
      </div>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Visiting Scientist Program</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>A researcher requests funds to enable them to visit another institution
              for collaborative work. The visit would be expected to last ~2 weeks,
              requiring funds of ~$3,000 per visit per visitor, to fund lodging, travel
              and subsistence for visitors to collaborate with colleagues. The program
              would include a deliverable (e.g. a paper draft or funding proposal) as
              part of the program. Six such visitors could be funded annually for a
              cost of $18,000 per year for the visitor program. </p>
              <p>Please note: This will only be included in the program if the pandemic
                situation is safe enough for it to be viable, and that it can be safely
                offered to all members on a fair basis.  </p>
          </div>

          <section-title>Partnership Proposals</section-title>
          <p>The goal of Partnership proposals is to foster a meaningful and productive
            long-term partnerships between groups and institutions, with the
          specific aim of enhancing diversity and equity in science.  </p>
          <p>Programs that aim to develop series of seminars, webinars or bootcamps
            to get new partner institutes up to speed about the potential of LSST
            and to help them navigate the opportunities that it offers would also be
            welcome.</p>
          <p>The program recognizes that cultivating real partnerships takes time,
          and we encourage proposals that aim to lay groundwork for longer-term initiatives.
          At the time of proposal, it is envisaged that these partnerships should
          involve at least two active and equal partners (as opposed to seeking
          partners at a later stage), but the program plans may
          be in a nascent state and we encourage programs designed to identify barriers
          to participation in research and explore ways to overcome them.  </p>
          The following examples are given as a guide:
          <button type="button" class="collapsible">JEDI Group + Small Research Institute Partnership Proposal</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>The Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Group from a participating
            Science Collaboration has existing links with university serving a community traditionally
          witheld from astronomy.  The university has a small astronomy department with one
          member of staff who has both teaching and research duties, and a scientific interest
        in Rubin. </p>
        <p>Together, they propose to develop a partnership to incorporate Rubin research
        into the staff member's research and the student training program in a sustainable
        way.  The practical goals of the proposal include holding regular meetings designed to
        understand the
      challenges faced by the students and staff at the university, and develop the means
      to overcome them, including laying the groundwork for future development and fund
      raising activities. The proposal requests funding to enable both staff and students
      at the university, and members of the JEDI group to dedicate time to these activities. </p>
          </div>
          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Universities Partnership</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Two Science Collaboration members at neighboring institutions share scientific interests in Rubin,
              and are long-standing collaborators.
              Both institutions serve students from communities traditionally witheld from astronomy.  </p>
            <p>They propose to explore how their complementary skill sets can be combined
            to further the goals of a topical Task Force within the Science Collaboration,
            and identify infrastructural limitations standing in the way of their progress.
            They propose to explore whether computing resources provided by the Rubin
            international in-kind program can be used to address these limitations.  </p>
          </div>
          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Science Collaboration Working Group + regional University</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>A Science Collaboration Working Group with existing links to a regional
              university would like to develop a Citizen Science Program to encourage
            members of the public to engage with their science.  The regional university
            brings expertise in web development and its students gain credit for the
            development project.  </p>
          <p>They propose for funds to enable the proposing team to dedicate time
            to the project, and for equipment for the students. </p>
