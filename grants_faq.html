<page-title>Kickstarter Grants FAQ</page-title>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can a person be involved with more than one proposal?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Yes.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Are Science Collaboration chairs and group/task force coordinators eligible to apply?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Absolutely!  The program is designed to encourage all contributions to Science Collaborations, since
    they benefit the wider community.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">If I request funds for childcare support,
    are there any restrictions on who provides that care?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>No, you should decide who cares for your children!  You only need to describe
      in your proposal how funding childcare will enable your Rubin-related science. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">I'd like to propose for travel funds
    to enable a collaborator to come and work with me, but I see in the examples
    that this is subject to a caveat.  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The ongoing pandemic and uneven availability of vaccines means that we
    all face rapidly changing travel restrictions, which are different in different
   parts of the world.  You are welcome to propose for travel funds, but we recommend
 that you include a contingency plan describing how the work will proceed in the event
that travel is not possible. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Grant applications and the LSST International In-kind Program</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Members of the three participating Science Collaborations who are based outside
      the US/Chile are welcome to submit proposals, regardless of the status of any
      In-kind proposal they are involved with.  Although the topic of your proposal
      should not directly overlap with the activities covered in your in-kind program,
    complementary activities are encouraged, particularly those that benefit
    underserved communities and the Science Collaborations in general.</p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">My institution has different rules about receiving grants versus gifts.  If my proposal is successful, what category would an award fall into?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>You are encouraged to contact the Program Lead directly to discuss your situation in detail.
      In general, we prefer to distribute the awards as grants but we can do so as gifts if necessary
      to US-based institutions.  The limit of 15% on any institutional overhead remains the same. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Who should I describe as the "sponsor organization" in my institution's documentation?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>This program is funded by the Heising-Simons Foundation via a grant to Las Cumbres Observatory,
    who are handling the administration of the kickstarter grant awards.  For these
  purposes, the sponsor organization is therefore Las Cumbres Observatory.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can I apply for money to partially fund a student or post-doc position?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Yes, you may apply for funds to put towards a student or post-doc position, provided that
    you already have funding secured for the rest of that position.  You should explain in your proposal
  how the full position will be funded, and how this proposal will enable Rubin-research by you and your
post-doc/student. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">There are logistical difficulties which mean my institution can't receive funds from some or part of my grant proposal.  What can I do?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>If your proposal is successful, we prefer that the funds be awarded through your home institution.  </p>
    <p>However, we are aware of a few instances where some or all of the elements of a proposal
      cannot be handled through the administration of some institutions.  </p>
    <p>If this is the case, you are strongly encouraged to discuss the issues with the Program Lead, Rachel Street.</p>
    <p>We can issue grants to individuals, independently of their institution, for all or part of their proposal.
    In these cases, the individual receiving the funds will be responsible for ensuring that they are legally allowed to
    receive funds this way, and for compiling with any legal, tax, immigration or other requirement.  </p>
    <p>For example, students in the US with J1 visas may not receive funds <em>except</em> through their
      employer, and so would have to have the grant received by their institution.</p>
    <p>It is not necessary for PIs to describe <em>how</em> they will receive funds in the proposal itself.
      Successful PIs will be contacted once the awards are made with administrative instructions.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Who has to provide details of their <em>other</em> sources of funding in the proposal?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Anyone who would receive funds from the proposal, if it is successful, should provide
    details of any other resources, funds and grants they have access to, either
  from grants or through their institution or other avenue.  Collaborators on the grant
  who will not receive funds from the proposal do not need to provide these details. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Do Partnership proposals have to include an institution with an "established Rubin research program"?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The main criterion for selecting partnership proposals is that the proposal should be
      focused on overcoming barriers to participation in research for communities that
    have historically had fewer opporunties, particularly those that have historically
    suffered from discrimination.</p>
    <p>One common barrier to entry that newcomers to the Rubin science community have raised is
    that Rubin is a very large, multi-faceted project, and it can be difficult to know how
  to get involved unless you have connections or join an established research program.  </p>
  <p>Encouraging Partnership between institutes to enable and enhance research programs by all partners,
     making this kind of institutional knowledge and experience more widely accessible,
      is one example of how this kind of barrier can be overcome. </p>
  <p>It is worth noting that this is just one example of a partnership, and many others
  are possible; the definition is not intended to be restrictive, but rather to emphasize
  that partnerships should be meaningful and equitable collaborations.  PIs are
  encouraged to consider how collaborating wih the Science Collaborations
  could help to enhance their research goals and opportunities for communities that
  have historically been witheld from astronomy.  </p>
