<page-title>Kickstarter Grants FAQ</page-title>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can a person be involved with more than one proposal?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Yes.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Are Science Collaboration chairs and group/task force coordinators eligible to apply?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Absolutely!  The program is designed to encourage all contributions to Science Collaborations, since
    they benefit the wider community.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">If I request funds for childcare support,
    are there any restrictions on who provides that care?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>No, you should decide who cares for your children!  You only need to describe
      in your proposal how funding childcare will enable your Rubin-related science. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">I'd like to propose for travel funds
    to enable a collaborator to come and work with me, but I see in the examples
    that this is subject to a caveat.  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The ongoing pandemic and uneven availability of vaccines means that we
    all face rapidly changing travel restrictions, which are different in different
   parts of the world.  You are welcome to propose for travel funds, but we recommend
 that you include a contingency plan describing how the work will proceed in the event
that travel is not possible. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Grant applications and the LSST International In-kind Program</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Members of the three participating Science Collaborations who are based outside
      the US/Chile are welcome to submit proposals, regardless of the status of any
      In-kind proposal they are involved with.  Although the topic of your proposal
      should not directly overlap with the activities covered in your in-kind program,
    complementary activities are encouraged, particularly those that benefit
    underserved communities and the Science Collaborations in general.</p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">My institution has different rules about receiving grants versus gifts.  If my proposal is successful, what category would an award fall into?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>You are encouraged to contact the Program Lead directly to discuss your situation in detail.
      In general, we prefer to distribute the awards as grants but we can do so as gifts if necessary
      to US-based institutions.  The limit of 15% on any institutional overhead remains the same. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Who should I describe as the "sponsor organization" in my institution's documentation?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>This program is funded by the Heising-Simons Foundation via a grant to Las Cumbres Observatory,
    who are handling the administration of the kickstarter grant awards.  For these
  purposes, the sponsor organization is therefore Las Cumbres Observatory.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can I apply for money to partially fund a student or post-doc position?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Yes, you may apply for funds to put towards a student or post-doc position, provided that
    you already have funding secured for the rest of that position.  You should explain in your proposal
  how the full position will be funded, and how this proposal will enable Rubin-research by you and your
post-doc/student. </p>
  </div>
