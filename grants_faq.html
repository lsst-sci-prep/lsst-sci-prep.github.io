  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can a person be involved with more than one proposal?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Yes.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Are Science Collaboration chairs and group/task force coordinators eligible to apply?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Absolutely!  The program is designed to encourage all contributions to Science Collaborations, since
    they benefit the wider community.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">If I request funds for childcare support,
    are there any restrictions on who provides that care?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>No, you should decide who cares for your children!  You only need to describe
      in your proposal how funding childcare will enable your Rubin-related science. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">I'd like to propose for travel funds
    to enable a collaborator to come and work with me, but I see in the examples
    that this is subject to a caveat.  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The ongoing pandemic and uneven availability of vaccines means that we
    all face rapidly changing travel restrictions, which are different in different
   parts of the world.  You are welcome to propose for travel funds, but we recommend
 that you include a contingency plan describing how the work will proceed in the event
that travel is not possible. </p>
