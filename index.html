<p>We are delighted to announce a new research and community-building initiative for
members of the three participating Rubin Science Collaborations: <a href="https://lsst-tvssc.github.io/">Transients and
Variable Stars (TVS)</a>, <a href="https://rubin-smwlv.github.io/">Stars, Milky Way and Local Volume (SMWLV)</a> and
the <a href="http://lsst-sssc.github.io/">Solar System Science Collaboration (SSSC)</a>. </p>

<p>This has been made possible by generous support from the <a href="https://www.hsfoundation.org/">Heising-Simons Foundation</a>
  for research in galactic and Solar System science, with a particular focus on ensuring
  equity of opportunity, in keeping with the Foundation's goals. </p>
<p>This 1-year program will fund four key elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding science publications. This includes covering the full cost of contributions
  to the ApJS Special Edition on LSST survey strategy for papers from ALL Rubin Science Collaborations.
<li>Host online workshops. This includes the costs of using online platforms.
<li>Provide access to software and data platforms. This includes providing access to Cloud-based computing resources.
<li>Small grants program. Members will be able to apply for grants to enable research
  and service contributions that benefit the Science Collaborations as a whole,
  with incentives to foster partnerships that lower barriers to entry for Rubin research.
</ul>
