<p>We are delighted to announce a new research and community-building initiative for
members of the three participating Rubin Science Collaborations: <a href="https://lsst-tvssc.github.io/">Transients and
Variable Stars (TVS)</a>, Stars, Milky Way and Local Volume (SMWLV) and the Solar System Science Collaboration (SSSC). </p>

<p>This has been made possible by generous support from the <a href="https://www.hsfoundation.org/">Heising-Simons Foundation</a>
  for research in galactic and Solar System science, with a particular focus on ensuring
  equity of opportunity, in keeping with the Foundation's goals. </p>
<p>This 1-year program will fund four key elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding science publications. This includes covering the full cost of contributions
  to the ApJS Special Edition on LSST survey strategy for papers from ALL Rubin Science Collaborations.
<li>Host online workshops. This includes the costs of using online platforms.
<li>Provide access to software and data platforms. This includes providing access to Cloud-based computing resources.
<li>Small grants program. Members will be able to apply for grants to enable research
  and service contributions that benefit the Science Collaborations as a whole,
  with incentives to foster partnerships that lower barriers to entry for Rubin research.
</ul>
<p>TVS, SMWLV and SSSC will host a joint virtual meeting on Thursday, 29 July 2021
  at 8am PDT / 11am EDT / 5pm CEST to present this opportunity in more detail.
  Connection details have been circulated to all members.  </p>
<p>The session will be recorded and shared online for the benefit of members who
  cannot attend at the time, and time will be allowed for a Q&A. </p>
  <p>We encourage all members of the Rubin Science Collaborations to attend.</p>
