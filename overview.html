title: Overview
---

<p>The twin goals of this program are to promote excellence in Rubin-related
  research by enabling members of the three participating Science
  Collaboration to dedicate time to preparatory work in advance of the
  survey starting operations, and to ensure that research opportunities and
  facilities are accessible on a
  fair and equitable basis to all Science Collaboration members and to overcome
  common barriers to entry and participation.</p>

<p>This has been made possible by generous support from the <a href="https://www.hsfoundation.org/">Heising-Simons Foundation</a>
    for research in galactic and Solar System science, with a particular focus on ensuring
    equity of opportunity, in keeping with the Foundation's goals. </p>
  <p>This 1-year program will fund four key elements:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Funding science publications. This includes covering the full cost of contributions
    to the ApJS Special Edition on LSST survey strategy for papers from ALL Rubin Science Collaborations.
  <li>Host online workshops. This includes the costs of using online platforms.
  <li>Provide access to software and data platforms. This includes providing access to Cloud-based computing resources.
  <li>Small grants program. Members will be able to apply for grants to enable research
    and service contributions that benefit the Science Collaborations as a whole,
    with incentives to foster partnerships that lower barriers to entry for Rubin research.
  </ul>

  <p>TVS, SMWLV and SSSC hosted the following joint virtual meeting on Thursday, 29 July 2021
    to present this opportunity in more detail.</p>
